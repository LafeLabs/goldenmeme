# Replicator

To replicate this whole thing, start with a Geometron page and use pagelist.php to create a new thing using thing maker(this needs to be created).


What is the thing?  Each instance of this thing has a physical card or sign or marker with the url of the factory where these images are made, a email or phone number for an author who can help replicate, a hashtag for social media sharing of images made from this, the name of the thing "GoldenMeme", and the symbol for it, generally a Golden Spiral made from Golden Rectangles with squares and arcs.  Each instance is in a place or associated with some abstract "place" like a group of people or person or organization(like a class in a school).  An instance of GoldenMeme is in a directory inside an existing Geometron Web instance.
