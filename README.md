# GoldenMeme

## Meme factory based on putting geometry with Golden Ratio over uploaded photographs. 

This is self-replicating media based on the Golden Ratio.  

This is generally connected with a place, either a physical place or a place in the sense of a group of people, person, or organization.  The way this works is as follows:


1. Upload images of things in our environment to the Map Editor
2. Put a symbol with Golden Ratio geometry in it over the top of the image, align, scale, and rotate that symbol as desired 
3. Screen capture that
4. Crop the screen capture to remove identifying information and give it a nicer size and shape, then post to social media with the designated hashtag specific to this instance of GoldenMeme

This is the basic operation of any given instance of GoldenMeme: it creates graphical content which is shared online on existing social media using a unifying hashtag which all users can share to create a shared experience of appreciating the Golden Ratio geometry in a given place.  The other main task for those of us who use this is to replicate it.  For that we follow the instructions on the [replicator](replicator/) page of this page.
